# COMP0035 2023-24 Coursework

Use this README.md to explain to the markers how to set up your project for COMP0035 coursework 1 and coursework 2.

The project structure follows
the ['Tests as part of the application code'](https://docs.pytest.org/en/7.1.x/explanation/goodpractices.html#tests-as-part-of-application-code)

Do not delete, move or rename the following files and folders:

- `LICENSE`
- `README.md`
- `.gitignore`
- `pyproject.toml`
- `requirements.txt`
- `src/__init__.py`
- `src/coursework1` and the files within it: `__init__.py`,`data_prep.py`
- `src/coursework2` and the files within it: `__init__.py`,`employee.py`
- `src/coursework2/tests` and the files within it: `__init__.py`,`test_code.py`, `test_employee.py`
